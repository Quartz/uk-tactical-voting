        "It is a time of political upheaval in much of the world. But none more so than in the UK, which is going for a second general election in just over two years.",
        "The UK surprised the world by voting to leave the EU in June last year. Soon after that Theresa May took over the prime ministership from her predecessor David Cameron. According to the rules, she could’ve continued to govern the country until 2020, but she has taken a gamble by calling for a general election. That’s because the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/27/lib-dems-shouldnt-count-on-remain-votes-the-data-looks-bleak\">latest polls</a> suggest that, on June 8, Brits would vote to give her Conservative party an even bigger majority than it has currently.",
        "Typically campaigns for general elections start many years in advance. Instead, this time May’s “snap” election gives the country’s many political parties only weeks to organise, campaign, and sway voters. What perhaps makes life easier for them is that the election is, in effect, about only one thing: <a href=\"https://qz.com/on/brexit/\">Brexit</a>.",
        "The upshot is that voters really have only one of two choices. Give May’s right-leaning party a bigger majority to ensure Brexit happens on <a href=\"https://qz.com/943292/brexit-begins-the-uk-now-has-two-years-to-untangle-itself-from-the-european-union/\">her terms</a>. Or vote for the left-leaning opposition parties, who may be fractured in what they are promising, but at least they all oppose giving May a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-04-23/blair-warns-against-brexit-blank-check-for-may-in-u-k-vote\">blank check</a>.",
        "Current polls suggest a surge in the Conservative vote since the 2015 general election. And, yet, whether you are for May’s Brexit or against, tactical voting could significantly change the outcome of the election. Quartz’s analysis below shows which seats could realistically make the difference."
    ],
    "section_2": [
        "In making the calculation, we’ve overlaid data from the 2015 general elections and  the 2016 Brexit referendum. The realistic chances are determined by whether a particular seat has enough of a chance to swing from “leave” to “remain” (or vice-versa) and whether that swing could enable a large enough voter base to cast a tactical vote.",
        "Of course, the left-leaning parties—Labour, Liberal Democrats, Scottish Nationalist Party, and Green—have differences among them on what they think about Brexit. But tactical voting could work because they are unified in their opposition to Theresa May’s Brexit.",
        "On the opposite site, May has the upper hand of gaining from a large proportion of UK Independence Party voters. Those who chose the far-right party in 2015 did so mainly to leave the EU, but since the referendum the party has lost steam and it could mean the voters would tactically vote for May.",
        "There is a chance for a greater swing. Such a hypothetical best-case scenario would make a much larger difference to the outcome of the election, as can be seen in the maps below."
    ],
    "section_3": [
        "For this tactical voting guide, we’ve made a few assumptions. First, we assume that every voter on only one side of the Brexit divide will engage in tactical voting. That, of course, is unlikely but it helps us understand the range of extreme outcomes for the 2017 election. Second, each side’s tactical vote is aided by a 5% swing from the left to the right (or vice versa), which we believe is a modest estimate. The final swing may be a lot more or a lot less. Finally, we understand that there are, for instance, Labour voters who would prefer May’s Brexit and Conservative voters who would oppose it. Our model is based on what the parties currently say they are likely to do if given power, but our swing vote calculations take into account some amount of reverse tactical voting (where a right-leaning remain voter chooses UKIP over Conservatives to undermine May’s Brexit or a left-leaning leave voter chooses Liberal Democrats over Labour)."
